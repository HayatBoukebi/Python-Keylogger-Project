A keylogger is a type of surveillance software or hardware device designed to record the keystrokes made by a user on their computer. Keyloggers can capture everything typed on the keyboard, including passwords, personal messages, and other sensitive information. They are often used for malicious purposes but can also have legitimate uses, such as monitoring employee activity or for debugging software.
